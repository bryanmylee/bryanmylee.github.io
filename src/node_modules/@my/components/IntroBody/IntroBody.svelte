      Talk to me about all things tech! I am a computer geek first and foremost,
      with a passion for software development. In my free time, I enjoy building

      I am currently pursuing a computer science degree from Singapore Management
      University, but I also enjoy learning outside of class and keeping up with
      the industry. I am especially interested in software architecture and design
      patterns, and I always strive to write beautiful code.
