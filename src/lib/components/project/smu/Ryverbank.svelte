	<p>We designed a simple trading platform for our SMU-X sponsor &mdash; Credit Suisse.</p>
	<p>
		Given multiple core functionalities in our requirements, we developed the solution with
		microservices to reduce the complexity of each functionality and enable each developer to work
		semi-independently.
	</p>
	<p>We also developed a simple ML-powered stock recommendation engine.</p>
	<p>
		For our efforts, we were awarded the <strong>Best Technical Team</strong> achievement.
	</p>
